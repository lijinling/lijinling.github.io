What information does GoodWind collect?
GoodWind doesn’t collect personal information. GoodWind also doesn’t collect information about the websites you visit or with whom or what you communicate.

If you are creating or logging into an account with a cloud provider through the GoodWind Manager, we don’t obtain any information you provide to your cloud provider, such as your email address, name, billing information, and payment details.

Information we obtain automatically
We collect two types of information automatically.

1. Server IP
The GoodWind server IP is collected when the server automatically updates with the latest security and feature improvements. The Server IP may identify the cloud server provider and the city in which the GoodWind server has been set up, but this doesn’t provide information about who’s running the server or who is accessing it.

2. Non personally identifiable technical information
If GoodWind crashes or a fatal exception occurs, or if you manually send feedback through the GoodWind app, the information listed below will be reported. This information will only be used to help identify and fix stability or performance issues.

GoodWind Unique Device ID. This ID is randomly generated client-side and does not map to the Android Unique Device Identifier.

Date and time of crash / exception and up to 100 prior events, like that of a user opening the ‘About’ section

This information is transferred using HTTPS to Sentry (sentry.io), a third-party, open source error tracking provider. Sentry uses a variety of industry-standard technologies and services to secure your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and loss. If you have any questions about Sentry’s policies, please visit https://sentry.io/security/ and https://sentry.io/privacy/, or contact security@sentry.io. All GoodWind data stored by Sentry is restricted such that only members of the GoodWind team can access it.

Information we obtain only upon opt-in
GoodWind reports the following information to the GoodWind team upon opt-in.

1. Anonymous usage metrics
Each GoodWind server automatically collects, for the last hour and on a per access key basis, the number of bytes transferred and the country of origin of the credentials used. Neither the contents of the communication nor any personally identifiable metadata (e.g. logins, emails, device IDs, etc) is logged.

By default, GoodWind Servers do not share these metrics with the GoodWind team. If the Server administrator explicitly opts in to sharing anonymous metrics, this information will be securely sent to the GoodWind team every hour. After 60 days, the usage metrics will be aggregated to the country level. Server administrators can change their anonymous metrics sharing preference anytime by visiting the ‘Settings’ menu in the GoodWind Manager.

We appreciate you sharing with us anonymous metrics about your server usage, as we use them to measure usage trends and improve the product.

For example, if a Server administrator opts in to sharing anonymous metrics with us, we could receive information indicating that a Server with ID 12345 has been used over 3 hours yesterday, transferring a total of 500 megabytes of data, from one or more devices physically located in Argentina.

2. Your comments and email if you submit feedback
The GoodWind Manager and GoodWind Apps allow you to submit feedback to the team. We recommend not including personally identifiable information, but an email field is optionally available if you would like to obtain a response from the team.
